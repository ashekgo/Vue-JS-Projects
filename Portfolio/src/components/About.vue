let about = "I'm a self motivated frontend developer who is skilled in the concepts of modern web development frontend framework. Have hands on practical experiences with Vue.js concepts like API handling, Components & Props, Provide Inject, Slots, Router, Management using Pinia, Authentication etc. The best part I have is the self motivation which keeps me stronger if I get stacked. My problem solving approach is simple. First I simplify the problem using sketch, then I search, post and use AI to solve that particular problem. This is my real life problem solving skills which is my biggest  strength as a developer."
